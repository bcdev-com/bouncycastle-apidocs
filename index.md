title: C# API
---

These are the API docs auto-generated by running [DocFx](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/) version [2.78.3](https://www.nuget.org/packages/docfx/2.78.3) over [BouncyCastle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/) version [2.6.2](https://github.com/bcgit/bc-csharp/releases/tag/release-2.6.2) C# source code.

> This is not provided by, or affiliated with, the Legion of the Bouncy Castle.  It is just a personal resource from the published source code that I generated for myyself but posted publicly in case anyone else finds the lack of an official API documentation source frustrating.

There is a little bit of [overview documentation](https://www.bouncycastle.org/documentation/documentation-c/#documentation) in PDF form on BouncyCastle's official website and a great deal of detailed references to [external specification and interoperability documents](https://www.bouncycastle.org/documentation/documentation-c/#documentation) as well. 

The [API](~/api/Org.BouncyCastle.html) link on the menu above is my attempt to fill the gap.  You'll likely want to start in the [Crypto](~/api/Org.BouncyCastle.Crypto.html), [Security](~/api/Org.BouncyCastle.Security.html) and [Utilities](~/api/Org.BouncyCastle.Utilities.html) namespaces.
